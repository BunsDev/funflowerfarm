# Funflower Farm

A blockchain based game where players can play to earn Funflower farm Tokens.

The game is a fork from [sunflower farmers](https://github.com/sunflower-land/sunflower-land/tree/399f5633426b788307b992322d1d157c1a59114d) when the game had MIT licence, we want to change the game and improve to make it easy to play for new players avoiding paywalls and also a change in the game design by adding a solid and fun adventure system

# How does it work?

For more details, please see the guide - https://funflowerfarm.com/

# Code Structure

The Front-end is a Decentralized App (Dapp) that can be found in `src/dapp`.

# ðŸ‘¶ Getting Started

The dapp is currently pointed at the production backend and to polygon mainnet blockchain. This is a web3 crypto app that is part on-chain and part off-chain<br>

The easy way to start is to clone this repo, and build the front-end that is pointing to production. You can then make changes in the front and iterate:

1. `npm install --global yarn` (if you don't have yarn installed)
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn dev`
